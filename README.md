# Haptic Teleoperation in RAIN hub project
---
## Overview
This is a repository of visual/haptic-teleoperated industrial robotic manipulators in RAIN hub project (https://rainhub.org.uk/). 
At the moment, this source file is a gazebo model for UR5 and Robotiq 3-finger gripper.

## Installation

### Environment setting

- Install ROS as in http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
- Install Gazebo ROS pakcage as in http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing (Instruction for ROS Kinetic)

### Building from Source

#### Dependencies
The dependencies required are as follows: 

(1) Universal robot package (https://bitbucket.org/inmojang/universal_robot)


(2) Robotiq 3-finger gripper package (https://inmojang@bitbucket.org/inmojang/robotiq.git)


Note: Some of the dependencies are originally from other repositories (please refer to each repo's git), but modified for this project. 




### Packages Overview

This repository consists of following packages:

* ***rain*** the meta-package for the teleoperation system meta package
* ***rain_description*** contains the urdf description of the integrated robot (UR5 + the gripper).
* ***rain_gazebo*** contains the launch file for the gazebo simulator.

## Usage

Launch the Gazebo simulator:

        roslaunch rain_gazebo ur5_robotiq.launch

#### Control the gripper

##### Via Keyboard Teleoperation

To control the gripper, in another terminal, excute below in the command line:
        
        rosrun robotiq_s_model_control SModelController_gazebo.py

The gripper has Basic/Pinch/Wide/Scissor modes, and the fingers can also be individually controlled. 


##### Via ***rostopic pub*** 

Closing the hand halfway:

        rostopic pub --once right_hand/command robotiq_s_model_control/SModel_robot_output {1,0,1,0,0,0,127,255,0,155,0,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0}

Fully open the hand:

        rostopic pub --once right_hand/command robotiq_s_model_control/SModel_robot_output {1,0,1,0,0,0,0,255,0,155,0,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0}

Change the grasping mode to pinch and close the gripper:

        rostopic pub --once right_hand/command robotiq_s_model_control/SModel_robot_output {1,1,1,0,0,0,255,255,0,155,0,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0}

Switch to wide mode and fully open the hand:

        rostopic pub --once right_hand/command robotiq_s_model_control/SModel_robot_output {1,2,1,0,0,0,0,255,0,155,0,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0}

Change to scissor mode and close the fingers:

        rostopic pub --once right_hand/command robotiq_s_model_control/SModel_robot_output {1,3,1,0,0,0,255,255,0,155,0,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0}

Open fingers:

        rostopic pub --once right_hand/command robotiq_s_model_control/SModel_robot_output {1,3,1,0,0,0,0,255,0,155,0,0,255,0,0,0,0,0,0}




#### Control the arm

##### Via Keyboard Teleoperation

Execute below in the command line to control each joint using a keyboard: 

        rosrun ur_driver gazebo_teleop_key.py
